Machine learning is no exception. The success of data-driven learning methods is based on the ingenious ideas of thousands of talented researchers over the field’s 60-year history. But their recent popularity is also fueled by the evolution of hardware and software solutions that make them scalable and accessible. The ecosystem of excellent libraries for numeric computing, data analysis, and machine learning built around Python like NumPy and scikit-learn gained wide adoption in research and industry. This has greatly helped propel Python to be the most popular programming language.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Massive improvements in computer vision, text, speech, and other tasks brought by the recent advent of deep learning techniques exemplify this theme. Approaches draw on neural network theory of the last four decades that started working remarkably well in combination with GPUs and highly optimized compute routines.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Our goal with building PyTorch over the past five years has been to give researchers the most flexible tool for expressing deep learning algorithms while taking care of the underlying engineering complexities. We benefited from the excellent Python ecosystem. In turn, we’ve been fortunate to see the community of very talented people build advanced deep learning models across various domains on top of PyTorch. The authors of this book were among them.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I’ve known Sebastian within this tight-knit community for a few years now. He has unmatched talent in easily explaining information and making the complex accessible. Sebastian contributed to many widely used machine learning software packages and authored dozens of excellent tutorials on deep learning and data visualization.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 31pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mastery of both ideas and tools is also required to apply machine learning in practice. Getting started might feel intimidating, from making sense of theoretical concepts to figuring out which software packages to install.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Luckily, the book you’re holding in your hands does a beautiful job of combining machine learning concepts and practical engineering steps to guide you in this journey. You’re in for a delightful ride from the basics of data-driven techniques to the most novel deep learning architectures. Within every chapter, you will find concrete code examples applying the introduced methods to a practical task.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">When the first edition came out in 2015, it set a very high bar for the <i>ML and Python </i>book category. But the excellence didn’t stop there. With every edition, Sebastian and the team kept upgrading and refining the material as the deep learning revolution unfolded in new domains. In this new PyTorch edition, you’ll find new chapters on transformer architectures and graph neural networks. These approaches are on the cutting edge of deep learning and have taken the fields of text understanding and molecular structure by storm in the last two years. You will get to practice them using new yet widely popular software packages in the ecosystem like Hugging Face, PyTorch Lightning, and PyTorch Geometric.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The excellent balance of theory and practice this book strikes is no surprise given the authors’ combination of advanced research expertise and experience in solving problems hands-on. Sebastian Raschka and Vahid Mirjalili draw from their background in deep learning research for computer vision and computational biology. Hayden Liu brings the experience of applying machine learning methods to event prediction, recommendation systems, and other tasks in the industry. All of the authors share a deep passion for education, and it reflects in the approachable way the book goes from simple to advanced.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I’m confident that you will find this book invaluable both as a broad overview of the exciting field of machine learning and as a treasure of practical insights. I hope it inspires you to apply machine learning for the greater good in your problem area, whatever it might be.</p><p class="s1" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 153%;text-align: justify;">Dmytro Dzhulgakov PyTorch Core Maintainer</p></body></html>
